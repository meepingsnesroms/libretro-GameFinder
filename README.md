# GUI game finder based on [libretro-db](https://github.com/libretro/RetroArch/tree/master/libretro-db)

Used to find a games you might be intrested in.
Can filter by year, console, genre, name and in the future maybe tags(War, Hamsters, Minecraft-like, etc...).

How to use:
1) Put all "*.rdb" files in a directory.
2) Create a directory named "assets" in the directory with the rdb files.
3) Copy platform thumbnail dirs to "./assets".
4) Load RetroArch and select a ".rdb" file in that directory, and choose libretro-GameFinder
5) You can now browse all games for that platform, and in the future edit or add entrys and submit them to [libretro-database](https://github.com/libretro/libretro-database)
